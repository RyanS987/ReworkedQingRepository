As a result Austria has closed it's borders for Serbian import and export. Since main Serbian export was livestock, particularly the pigs, this trade war got named as Pig war. \nIt forced Serbian government to look outwards for exports, but unlike when exporting to Austria, Serbian nation can't export alive livestock so the trade war forced Serbian government to finally start industrialization.

In the last years of the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, the Second Boer War (1899–1902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration. "

 PER_idea_rural_society:0 "Rural Society"
 PER_idea_rural_society_desc:0 "Persia, dwarfed in comparison to the economies of the European and American nations, and cursed with political instability, is in a difficult position to modernise. The rapid decline has distracted the Persian nation from adapting its agrarian economy, and with it comes the cost of heavy economic reliance and a lack of infrastructure to industrialise from. And while the Persian army does not suffer from this as much as it logically should due to the military missions sent by the European powers, Persia is left completely vulnerable to invasion due to its lack of an industrial base, even from tribes inside of its borders. The revolutionary instability has already done grave harm to the integrity and glue of the nation, and this lack of centralisation is the cherry on top of Persia's problems."

From what the constitutionalists perceive, Persia had been a nation stuck in time with its reactionary regime opposing all reform. King Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar, the monarch up to 1906, had signed a constitution shortly before his passing. The succession turned to Mohammed Ali Shah, who then went on to abolish the constitution and bomb the parliament building. Pro-constitutional elements then went on to force his abdictation and reestablish the constitution, but not without its harm to the integrity of the nation. After a destabilising civil war and foreign interventions, Persia now stands at the crossroads of history. Facing political decay and disorder, whoever succeeds is completely up to the sands of time."

From its geographic location, Persia was seen by both nations as a buffer zone against the other. Persia, if controlled by the British, would expose Russia's underbelly, that is the Caucasus and Central Asia. Were it to be under Russian control, it would cut through the British Empire, exposing Kuwait and Baluchistan. The Persian diplomats, eager to exploit this prospect, wanted to use this cold war to secure Persian independence by playing both sides against each other. This foreign policy strategy, however, failed tremendously, following the softening of relations between the Russian Empire and the British Empire."
