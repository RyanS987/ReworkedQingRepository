When Emperor Guangxu died in 1908, it is suspected Pu Wei was a potential heir. Now, Pu Wei has been given a role as 'Minister of Smoking', a arbitrary role suspected to be because prominent officials such as Zaifeng dont like how close he was to the throne. More conservative court officials such as Yikuang and Natong think the loyal man should be awarded a more prestigious role, while others like Zaifeng are quite satisfied with him being away from real politics. \n\nMaking a choice either way will inevitably offend one side of the court."

As such, the economy of the province is largely agricultural, with a traditional textile and food export. Some say we should do a large scale industrialization of the province, and focus efforts on preventing floods and making use of new water based power generation.

He has recieved foreign education in Japan and is a part of Kang Youwei's Empire Reform Association. He talks about grand reform and industrialization for the province, but some suspect him of having ties to the Tongmenghui.\n\nThe other is a old man from Manchuria, part of the Manchu White Banner. He has adminstrated several provinces over the last 30 years, and his loyalty is unquestionable. Min-zhe is a naturally rebellious province, and having this man in control would ensure atleast a loyal administration. In addition, being a friend of several court members, a large sum has been gathered by him, and it will be ours if he is appointed. However, he has long opposed reforms, being a strict conservative, and in the past has scarcely developed the provinces he has ruled industrially or socially.

Giving them a fair trial may risk several of them getting away with their crimes, and potentially continuing their devious activities. In addition, it is not like we can pretend our justice system is fair, with it just beginning to be reformed. \n\nOn the other hand, not giving them trials demonstrates our lack of commitment to our new legal code, and our dismissal of due law."

In 1907, he used a small rebellion as an excuse to orchestrate the removal of Cen from his post. A political struggle then ensued, known as the 'Political Struggle of Dingwei', where Cen rushed for Beijing and won the support of Empress Dowager's Cixi (the defacto ruler of China at the time) and continued to oust corrupt officials. Finally, though, Yuan Shikai once again switched sides, helping Prince Qing orchestrate his exile to Shanghai, despite his attempts to delay it.\n\nNow, we need another capable governor who is familiar with the massive Viceroy of Sichuan urgently, and we may have no choice but to call for his return."

 ww1_qing.335.d:0 "In Europe, and others influenced by it such as the United States and Japan, the bureaucracy has developed into the same refined method. A group of ministers, each managing a department, advise the chief executive on state affairs.\n\nThe Qing bureaucratic monarchy differs significantly from the ministerial system, despite initial visual similarities. Responsible for a vast, multi-ethinic empire, the Chinese governments have developed an intricate but outdated bureaucracy centered in Beijing over the last 700 years. \n\nThe central government includes prominent offices such as the Six Boards and the Censorate Grand Council handling administrative tasks, offering counsel to the emperor. However, these Six Boards are not like western institutions, being completely interconnected and with many officials holding multiple roles at the same time across multiple boards and the Grand Council. \n\nIn reality, there is no distinction between central, provincial, and local state functions. As such, to institute any of their ideas, the Boards must receive vast cooperation across all hierarchies of the 9 tier bureaucracy.\n\nIn addition, every official is appointed by the top, from the Grand Council to the most local administrators. The result has been a sort of inflation of officials, with too many qualified candidates to fit and thus many administrative roles being overfilled. The Six Boards often have executive committees of six equally ranked ministers each.\n\nThis system causes extreme problems for the empire. No minister is singly responsible for the actions of a position, or the conduct and corruption involved, and it is impossible to assign blame. The system has allowed corruption to grow rampant, as officials are overstretched covering multiple roles at the same time while there are too many unnecessary ones in obsolete roles.\n\nIn essence, the system is designed to prevent any one official from accumulating too much power, and to maximize the capability of the Emperor to intervene in any affair. In practice, the sheer amount of paperwork diverts all power to the conservative Manchu Grand Council. In addition, the Qing bureaucracy may be very stable but it is not nimble. Even the smallest reforms cannot be passed or implemented without broad consensus among officials, and systemic change requires either complete consensus or the hand of a reforming emperor.\n\n Strategy Recommendation - These two branches are concurrently exclusive (click the icon in tree to read description), meaning you can switch between them.

This university would be located on the site of the former imperial Tsinghua Gardens to form the new Tsinghua College, staffed by several prominent US and Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao. \n\nThe agreement was approved in 1909 by Theodore Roosevelt and the US Congress and is now ready to be implemented."

In the old code, the punishment for fornication is 90 strokes by heavy bamboo, and the outlawing of fornication has been in the code since the 7th century. \n\nShen Jiaben argues that law and morality should be seperated, and that fornication should only be prevented by Confucian education and the force of public opinion, and that, because fornication is not criminal in any European codes, we will face criticism from the west for continuing its punishment. \n\nOpponents of his say that the decriminalization of fornication leads to a outrageous seperation between law and morality, and the decriminalization will threaten social order and corrupt values held by the Chinese people. In addition, they argue that China need not fear foreign criticism, because China has its own moral standard, and that law should meet the customs and common sense of the people.\n\nAnyway, with arguments heard, it is time to make a decision.\n\n§BYou have 100 days until this event times out automatically, instead of 14.§!"

This principle is already a fundamental concept in pretty much all western legal codes. \n\nThis has greatly angered many court officials who see this not only as a violation of the Emperor's heavenly power, but also risky, in that we may need to throw dissidents in jail or execute them for whatever reason necessary to maintain the stability of our nation.\n\n§BYou have 100 days until this event times out automatically, instead of 14.§!"

Now, there is a large debate over the aspects of the new code, where much of the debate focuses on the role of 'lijiao' (Confucian Ethics/ Legal Morals). \n\nMany reformers see Western technologies/ethics as 'use' while Chinese ethics as the 'body'. They argue that while the 'body' is untouchable, the 'use' can be adopted with an open mind, although the 'use' may never damage the 'body'. In this, they argue that tradition confucian values must be upheld above all else, while also argueing it is okay to reform the legal code in a western manner. \n\nThere is also an argument over 'Legal Morals', in the question of whether or not it is permissible to make laws on moral issues, such as outlawing adultery. \n\nAnyway, the debate over these issues has reached a point where we will need to intervene."

The Qing Code is a traditional legal code based on Confucian values, a large percentage of which is based on statutes thousands of years old. \n\nShen Jiaben, an individual well versed in Qing law and a pragmatic reformer, is the individual in charge of the revision of the old code. He is in charge of introducing western legal principles to the Code, such as his 1905 revision abolishing 'lingchi' (death by a thousand cuts), decapitation, torture and public execution. In 1907, he introduced the 'Draft of Great Qing Criminal Code', and now has introduced the 'Transistional Criminal Code of the Great Qing' to the new PCA (Proto-Parliament), although this is again a draft. \n\nAnyway, he is expected to publish the 'Great Qing Criminal Code' soon, but we should expect unprecedented opposition from conservatives within the court."

With this historical difficulty, if you're reactionary like the Qing court and only react when events show up, you will be crushed and collapse. \n\nIt is also important to realize, however, that Hearts of Iron 4 is a video game, one where historical accuracy is not an excuse for a bad experience playing the mod.  Especially for first time players of the Qing Dynasty in this mod, perhaps you would rather have a more casual game, and it would be very hard to understand all the mechanisms you have to keep the Qing surviving. \n\nWith this in mind, I have begun the implementation of a difficulty system.

They alleged that Yang had bypassed the provincial assembly and gained imperial permission to issue the debt directly. After much debate, the PCA decided that Yang did in fact overreach his powers and broke the law, and appealed to the Court for guidence in deciding the punishment. \n\nInstead, our Grand Council shocked the PCA by drafting an edict in the name of the Emperor outright refusing to punish Yang, only criticising him for being careless. The PCA is completely outraged, but powerless in the face of the Emperor's edict. What should we do?"

The disbandment was the result of decades of criticism of our neglect of important western topics, as well as the frustration of those who found themselves trapped in the ancient system. However, the examination system was the primary mechanism we captured and held the loyalty of local-level elites. This loyalty ensured the integration of the Chinese state, and countered regional autonomy and the breakup of the centralized system. In this time of division, some have argued we should bring it back, but others have argued for continuing our embracement of western style institutions\n\n§BYou have 100 days until this event times out automatically, instead of 14.§!"

 ww1_qing.189.t:0 "Opium Suppression"
 ww1_qing.189.d:0 "In the late 1800's, provincial governors had become dependent on Opium taxes as a major source of income, which indirectly lead to a lesser financial burden for us. However, recently there has been a collected effort to supress Opium production across China, starting in 1901 under Cixi's New Reforms. There has been heavy opposition from farmers, retailers, users, and several infuential families. Additionally, Opium usage is high among students, soldiers, and the middle class, all of who, if we anger, could pose a serious risk to our stability. Still, estimates of domestic production fell from over 35,000 metric tons in 1906 to just 4,000 metric tons in 1911.

Throughout the game, we will get ‘snippets’ of history so that it is not overwhelming. The final one will unlock something…\n\n§OOur court§!, consisting of many Manchu Princes, officials, and conservative advisors, has been extremely reactionary to any reform, although willing to adapt some to save the dynasty. §RThey will stall any reform we attempt to pass, and we will either need to wait to calm them down, or appease/get around them through other methods.§!\n\n§CThe Tongmenghui§!, lead by Sun Yat-sen, is one of among many groups of revolutionary organizations who want the establishment of a republic. Sun Yat-sen, tired of the reactionary Qing court refusing to adopt any new technology and powerlessly watching as foreign powers trample their way around China, has concluded that the only way to save the country is to drive the Manchus out. Alongside him, the entire nation is increasingly anti-monarchist, and it will only take a spark to start a revolution. §R If the revolution timer ever reaches 0, a large scale revolution will breakout, where we can choose to play as the Republic. Even if crushed, the timer will begin again, and more will sprout up shortly if reform is not adopted. There is also a way to transition to a republic through the focus tree.§!\n\nThe Qing reforms have proven successful in the military. §GThe Beiyang New Army§!, lead by Yuan Shikai, is seemingly loyal to the dynasty, and remains the only real military force in China, with most other troops we have being regional armies and a few Manchu swordsmen and archers. In 1898, he crushed the 100 Days Reform, but since the ascension of the Xuantong Emperor, he has been forcefully exiled in Manchuria. §RHis exile was seen as disrespectful and shameful, and in the case of revolution against the empire, Yuan Shikai may not have any reason to remain loyal to the dynasty.§! Still, the Beiyang army acts as the balance to the fight between revolutionaries and the Qing. Both want Shikai on their side  §RBeiyang (Proto-Fascist) Influence can be used for political power, but too much endangers our stability and power. Hiring Yuan Shikai would mean recalling him from exile!§!\n\nThere are many in China ready for change, and many plans to reform China. As the country increasingly becomes more regional, the question of whether the country will even stay together remains uncertain as well.§R The only question is who will lead China through these tumultuous years...?§!"

They have asked you to try to comprehend what it is talking about. \n\nHere it reads: \n-------------------------------------\n'Hello! I am the developer for Qing. The content in this nation started as a submod long ago, and has now finally been integrated!! Anyway, thank you for taking the time out of your day to try it out.\n\nEssential Tips:\n\n- Use the Beiyang Army decisions. There is a reason they are at the top of the decisions!\n\n- The revolution is very hard to completely avoid, and very hard to fight, and fighting multiple revolutions is not uncommon. Instead of thinking about how to completely avoid the revolution, perhaps a better question would be whens the most strategic time to let the revolution happen.'\n-------------------------------------\n\nThere appears to be two more notes in the bottle.

There is also a way to peacefully transition. NOTE: China update is not yet done, so content may be spares.\n\n- Like the Qing nobles, you may choose not to read events, descriptions, and decisions. However, it is recommended to read them, as it will help you have a better understanding of the history and whats going on, as well as being able to grasp the situation at hand, allowing you to better predict future disasters that may be coming. \n\n- Decisions are extremely important. Keep track of them.\n\n- Keep track of weekly stability. \n\n- Almost everything is done through decisions, events, party popularity, and national spirits.\n\n- It is highly recommended that you interact with the Beiyang army decisions. It is essential for political power\n\n- The revolution is designed to be almost impossible to avoid entirely. Don’t be disappointed if you have to fight one or even a few of them.\n\n- More things to either worry about or use to modernize will show up over time\n\n- Events are common, so be prepared for your plans to be dashed if you linger too close to the edge\n\n-The anti-Court opposition decisions quickly refresh, and if you have spare political power or Xinhai days, it is easy to get rid of them"
