 ww1_qing.254.t:0 "Paper Money Circulation"
 ww1_qing.254.d:0 "In 1910, we standardized the paper money in China, using the Great Qing Government Bank we founded in 1905. Being the first centralized Chinese bank, the situation has been chaotic for years, but after much observation of foreign designs, we have printed enough money for circulation of the new legal tender."

 ww1_qing.253.t: "Tsinghua Fund"
 ww1_qing.253.d: "In 1900, the United States were given a share of the Boxer Indemnities. Believing it to be too much, they offered to re-invest this into our country. Many plans were proposed, such as Yuan Shikai's infrastructure plan, but in the end, it was agreed that the indemnity would be reduced by $10.8 million on the condition it was used to setup a western style university. This university would be located on the site of the former imperial Tsinghua Gardens to form the new Tsinghua College, staffed by several prominent US and Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao. \n\nThe agreement was approved in 1909 by Theodore Roosevelt and the US Congress and is now ready to be implemented."
 
 ww1_qing.250.t:0 "National Assembly convenes"
 ww1_qing.250.d:0 "Now the end of 1910, the National Assembly has convened. Our decision to delay it for so long, however, has convinced many that we are not sincere in our reform."
 ww1_qing.250.a:0 "Oh well."
 
 
 ww1_qing.249.t:0 "Edict on the role of Lijiao"
 ww1_qing.249.d:0 "The principle of 'lijiao', meaning Confucian Ethics and Legal Morals, is the core behind much conservative opposition. \n\nThe main issue of debate is that of the distinction between Western legal reform and the Chinese ethical core. Many in our government, including some of the most reform minded, note that all reforms must make sure not to violate lijiao at all times, and that the principles of Confucian ethics should be enforced by law. However, there is much debate over just how much reforms we can take to push or threaten lijiao. We have the choice the issue an opinion on this highly contentious matter."
 ww1_qing.249.a:0 "We must consider that lijiao may not be unbreakable"
 ww1_qing.249.b:0 "Just make sure lijiao is properly respected"
 ww1_qing.249.c:0 "Law and lijiao are unseperable!"
 
 ww1_qing.248.t:0 "Edict on Punishments"
 ww1_qing.248.d:0 "While many punishments such as 'lingchi', decapitation, and several other cruel punishments have already been outlawed, there are several more than Shen Jiaben wants removed. He believes that punishments such as striking with light and heavy bamboo sticks should not be within the new code. Are these legitimate concerns?"
 ww1_qing.248.a:0 "These punishments are far outdated."
 ww1_qing.248.b:0 "This is way too far"
 
 ww1_qing.247.t:0 "Edict on Fornication"
 ww1_qing.247.d:0 "In one of the most contentious issues of Shen Jiaben's draft new Qing Code, the issue of fornication, or consensual intercourse between two people not married, has been a point of extreme debate. In the old code, the punishment for fornication is 90 strokes by heavy bamboo, and the outlawing of fornication has been in the code since the 7th century. \n\nShen Jiaben argues that law and morality should be seperated, and that fornication should only be prevented by Confucian education and the force of public opinion, and that, because fornication is not criminal in any European codes, we will face criticism from the west for continuing its punishment. \n\nOpponents of his say that the decriminalization of fornication leads to a outrageous seperation between law and morality, and the decriminalization will threaten social order and corrupt values held by the Chinese people. In addition, they argue that China need not fear foreign criticism, because China has its own moral standard, and that law should meet the customs and common sense of the people.\n\nAnyway, with arguments heard, it is time to make a decision."
 ww1_qing.247.a:0 "Shen Jiaben is right. It is not a legal issue."
 ww1_qing.247.b:0 "This is way too far"
 
 ww1_qing.246.t:0 "Edict on Legal Filial Piety"
 ww1_qing.246.d:0 "Within Shen Jiaben's new Great Qing Criminal Code, one article states guarantees the right of children to be able defend themselves legally against their parents. In the old Qing Code, parents have ' the right to educate in all manners their children or grandchildren, and the latter must follow their teachings without resistance'. \n\nOur court and other defendends of lijiao (Confucian Ethics), opposed to this reform, state that if this were to be allowed, the patriarchal power of the family will be damaged. Anyway, what should be decided?"
 ww1_qing.246.a:0 "Children deserve a legitimate defense!"
 ww1_qing.246.b:0 "Children cannot be allowed to question their parents!"
 
 ww1_qing.245.t:0 "The Principle of Legality"
 ww1_qing.245.d:0 "Inside of Shen Jiaben's 1907 draft, he included the principle of legality, a principle that upholds that what constitutes a crimes and the manners of punishments must be supported by the law, and not arbitrarily chosen by the state for its own purposes whenever it wants. This principle is already a fundamental concept in pretty much all western legal codes. \n\nThis has greatly angered many court officials who see this not only as a violation of the Emperor's heavenly power, but also risky, in that we may need to throw dissidents in jail or execute them for whatever reason necessary to maintain the stability of our nation."
 ww1_qing.245.a:0 "This should be ingrained in the new legal code and every public official!"
 ww1_qing.245.b:0 "What? The Son of Heaven's court can do whatever they like to whomever they want"
 
 ww1_qing.244.t:0 "Great Qing Criminal Code"
 ww1_qing.244.d:0 "The time has come and Shen Jiaben has submitted his revision of the Qing Code, the Great Qing Criminal Code, to the Advisory Council (PCA). Now, there is a large debate over the aspects of the new code, where much of the debate focuses on the role of 'lijiao' (Confucian Ethics/ Legal Morals). \n\nMany reformers see Western technologies/ethics as 'use' while Chinese ethics as the 'body'. They argue that while the 'body' is untouchable, the 'use' can be adopted with an open mind, although the 'use' may never damage the 'body'. In this, they argue that tradition confucian values must be upheld above all else, while also argueing it is okay to reform the legal code in a western manner. \n\nThere is also an argument over 'Legal Morals', in the question of whether or not it is permissible to make laws on moral issues, such as outlawing adultery. \n\nAnyway, the debate over these issues has reached a point where we will need to intervene."
 ww1_qing.244.a:0 "We will see what we can do"
 
 ww1_qing.243.t:0 "Temporary Criminal Code"
 ww1_qing.243.d:0 "Since 1905, the reformation of the 'Qing Code' has been underway. The Qing Code is a traditional legal code based on Confucian values, a large percentage of which is based on statutes thousands of years old. \n\nShen Jiaben, an individual well versed in Qing law and a pragmatic reformer, is the individual in charge of the revision of the old code. He is in charge of introducing western legal principles to the Code, such as his 1905 revision abolishing 'lingchi' (death by a thousand cuts), decapitation, torture and public execution. In 1907, he introduced the 'Draft of Great Qing Criminal Code', and now has introduced the 'Transistional Criminal Code of the Great Qing' to the new PCA (Proto-Parliament), although this is again a draft. \n\nAnyway, he is expected to publish the 'Great Qing Criminal Code' soon, but we should expect unprecedented opposition from conservatives within the court."

 ww1_qing.239.d:0 "The Board of War is one of our Government Agencies that used to cover all military affairs during the Ming Dynasty. However, its powers since the establishment of our dynasty have become extremely limited and are now just administrative. With unprecendented Tongmenghui infiltration in our armies, perhaps it is time to bring back the Board of War?"
 ww1_qing.239.a:0 "This is necessary for the survivial of our nation."
 ww1_qing.239.b:0 "We will handle this ourselves."
 
 ww1_qing.238.t:0 "Optional: Difficulty Setting"
 ww1_qing.238.d:0 "Due to the difficult setting of the Qing Dynasy in 1910, with it collapsing only a little over a year later in 1911 historically, the game is made to be challenging and not easy. It is meant to simulate the experience of a Qing noble, where you must keep ontop of the options you have and what you can and could do. With this historical difficulty, if you're reactionary like the Qing court and only react when events show up, you will be crushed and collapse. \n\nIt is also important to realize, however, that Hearts of Iron 4 is a video game, one where historical accuracy is not an excuse for a bad experience playing the mod.  Especially for first time players of the Qing Dynasty in this mod, perhaps you would rather have a more casual game, and it would be very hard to understand all the mechanisms you have to keep the Qing surviving. \n\nWith this in mind, I have begun the implementation of a difficulty system. This is highly experimental, so may be removed or expanded in the future, with there only being 3 options as of now. For now, your choice now cannot be changed after making your decision. If you don't want to choose, then Historical is just the game with no modifications."

 ww1_qing.237.d:0 "Our refusal to budge on the issue of our cabinet has turned disasterous! To many, the mocked 'Princes' Cabinet is the proof that we don't care about reform, and that we want Manchu domination. In addition, several constitutionalists have turned away from our government, believing that we are not willing to change."
 ww1_qing.237.a:0 "So be it!"
 
 ww1_qing.236.t:0 "PCA petition on the Imperial Guard"
 ww1_qing.236.d:0 "Our recent decision to create the Imperial Guard has already caused much debate in the PCA. While the PCA recognizes the need of a small force to protect the capitol, it has voiced several concerns over our new policy. A large percent are not convinced that this is not a ploy to train a royalist army used to secure reactionary values, while others want us to include all ethnicities in this guard."
 ww1_qing.236.a:0 "I see no problem with any of these requests"
 ww1_qing.236.b:0 "A small guard yes, but, for safety, it must be Manchu!"
 ww1_qing.236.c:0 "We will permit all ethnicities, but there shall be no limitations to its size!"

 ww1_qing.196.d:0 "After the Hunan Bond incident and more incidents in Yunnan and Guangxi where the Grand Council overruled the PCA, the PCA has issued to the emperor, or in other words his regent, a Impeachment Memorial that, while not blaming individual members of the Grand Council, highlighted the corruption of the Grand Council as an institution. \n\nThe impeachment memorial was issued with an analogy: 'if China were a ship, and the officials were the crew, an irresponsible crew would cause the ship to sink.', in other words saying they were arguing for the establishment of a responsible cabinet"
 ww1_qing.195.d:0 "On the 6th of October 1910, the Hunan Provincial Assembly reported to the PCA that the governor of Hunan, Yang Wending, had issued 1.2 million taels in government bonds without such consultation. They alleged that Yang had bypassed the provincial assembly and gained imperial permission to issue the debt directly. After much debate, the PCA decided that Yang did in fact overreach his powers and broke the law, and appealed to the Court for guidence in deciding the punishment. \n\nInstead, our Grand Council shocked the PCA by drafting an edict in the name of the Emperor outright refusing to punish Yang, only criticising him for being careless. The PCA is completely outraged, but powerless in the face of the Emperor's edict. What should we do?"
 ww1_qing.193.d:0 "We have recently begun the process of reforming schools for our subjects, tranforming provincial academies into colleges, prefectual schools into middle/high schools, district schools into elementary schools, and developing new curriculums.

 ww1_qing.192.d:0 "In 1905, we disbanded the Civil Service exam, a system that required examination for advancement in government posts continually used and modified since the Sui Dynasty over 1300 years ago. The disbandment was the result of decades of criticism of our neglect of important western topics, as well as the frustration of those who found themselves trapped in the ancient system. However, the examination system was the primary mechanism we captured and held the loyalty of local-level elites. This loyalty ensured the integration of the Chinese state, and countered regional autonomy and the breakup of the centralized system. In this time of division, some have argued we should bring it back, but others have argued for continuing our embracement of western style institutions"
 ww1_qing.191.d:0 "We have recently been encouraging students to study abroad, especially in Japan.

 ww1_qing.189.d:0 "In the late 1800's, provincial governors had become dependent on Opium taxes as a major source of income, which indirectly lead to a lesser financial burden for us. However, recently there has been a collected effort to supress Opium production across China, starting in 1901 under Cixi's New Reforms. There has been heavy opposition from farmers, retailers, users, and several infuential families. Additionally, Opium usage is high among students, soldiers, and the middle class, all of who, if we anger, could pose a serious risk to our stability. Still, estimates of domestic production fell from over 35,000 metric tons in 1906 to just 4,000 metric tons in 1911. Now it is time to decide what our plan for the future will be"

Recently, though, we have become more open in the recent years after the first Sino-Japanese war and the failed Boxer Rebellion against the foreigners.\n\n§OOur court§W, consisting of many Manchu Princes, officials, and conservative advisors, has been extremely reactionary to any reform, although willing to adapt some to save the dynasty. §RThey will stall any reform we attempt to pass, and we will either need to wait to calm them down, or appease/get around them through other methods.§W\n\n§CThe Tongmenghui§W, lead by Sun Yat-sen, is one of among many groups of revolutionary organizations who want the establishment of a republic. Sun Yat-sen, tired of the reactionary Qing court refusing to adopt any new technology and powerlessly watching as foreign powers trample their way around China, has concluded that the only way to save the country is to drive the Manchus out. Alongside him, the entire nation is increasingly anti-monarchist, and it will only take a spark to start a revolution. §R If the revolution timer ever reaches 0, a large scale revolution will breakout, where we can choose to play as the Republic. Even if crushed, the timer will begin again, and more will sprout up shortly if reform is not adopted. There is also a way to transition to a republic through the focus tree.§W\n\nThe Qing reforms have proven successful in the military. §GThe Beiyang New Army§W, lead by Yuan Shikai, is seemingly loyal to the dynasty, and remains the only real military force in China, with most other troops we have being regional armies and a few Manchu swordsmen and archers. In 1898, he crushed the 100 Days Reform, but since the ascension of the Xuantong Emperor, he has been forcefully exiled in Manchuria. §RHis exile was seen as disrespectful and shameful, and in the case of revolution against the empire, Yuan Shikai may not have any reason to remain loyal to the dynasty.§W Still, the Beiyang army acts as the balance to the fight between revolutionaries and the Qing. Both want Shikai on their side  §RBeiyang (Proto-Fascist) Influence can be used for political power, but too much endangers our stability and power. Hiring Yuan Shikai would mean recalling him from exile!§W\n\nThere are many in China ready for change, and many plans to reform China.
